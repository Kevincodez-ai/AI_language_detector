## 🌍 Language Detection using NLP

This project is a lightweight and efficient **Language Detection model** that can identify the language of a given text input. Trained on a multilingual dataset spanning **17 global languages**, it uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and a supervised machine learning classifier to deliver accurate predictions in real time.

### ✨ Features

* 🔤 Detects languages from 17 different options
* 📊 Trained using vectorized textual features (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer)
* 🤖 Uses Scikit-learn classifiers like Logistic Regression
* 📈 High accuracy with minimal preprocessing
* 🧪 Ready to test with your own input via CLI or notebook

### 🧠 Supported Languages

* English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Arabic, Turkish, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy
* NLP preprocessing (tokenization, lowercasing, etc.)


### 📁 Dataset

Used a labeled multilingual dataset with clean text samples for each language (Kaggle/Custom corpus).

### 📌 Example

```python
